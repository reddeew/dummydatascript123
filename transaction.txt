•	Redshift – we need more experiments to show. Let create PoC on 
o	Materialized views and Aggregations – Create Mat view to precompute aggregations and test query performance, assess the trade-off between storage space and query speed
o	Stored Procedures
o	Security & Access Control 
o	Database Administration task – Back and Restore 
o	
o	With other AWS services 
	Developers & Analysts - Notebooks, Studio, etc.
	Data Scientists – Sagemaker
	BI - Quicksight
o	Performance testing
	Query – complex queries, various joins, aggregations, and subqueries.
	Concurrency – How many users can run? For now, we should just prove that many users can be running the queries in parallel?
	Data Loading time – how much time it takes to load the data. 
o	Scalability & Elasticity & Data 
o	If time permits, Compression and Encodings Available - 
o	If time permits, Concurrency and Workload Management
o	If time permits, Data distribution strategy.

•	Quicksight –  Run it like a daily progress update. Find a list of things that you want to PoC.
